if we are working with these code we need to firstly install express in working directory . i havent uploaded node_modules of express server due to it has more than 100 files.So git hub isnt uploading the node_modules.so just run the following command...
   
npm install express

and one more to get post values from html we need body-parser so

npm install body-parser
